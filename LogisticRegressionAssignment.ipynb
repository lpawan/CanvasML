So, if the value of z goes to positive infinity then the predicted value of y will become 1 and if it goes to negative infinity then the predicted value of y will become 0. And if the outcome of the sigmoid function is more than 0.5 then we classify that label as class 1 or positive class and if it is less than 0.5 than we can classify it to negative class or label as class 0. It helps us to make sure that predicted value has a defined range which aids us in differentiating the classes."

A threshold is set, any probability value below the threshold is a negative outcome, and anything more than the threshold is a favourable or the positive outcome.
